phenoptr[Reports] issues

- {tiff}
  - The CRAN version of {tiff} now includes support for the functionality required in phenoptr.
    The API for reading directory info is different from the one I implemented in akoyabio/tiff.
    The phenoptr has a readTIFFDirectory shim that allows it to work with either version of {tiff}

- {rtree}
  - rtree is a wrapper around the Boost library implementation, accessed via {BH}.
    Version 1.75.0-0 of BH upgraded to Boost 1.75.0 which requires C++ 14
    C++ 14 is supported in R 4.0.0. It is not fully supported in R 3.6
    - some discussion here: https://github.com/eddelbuettel/bh/issues/77
    Long-term I think the best fix is to stop supporting R 3.6 which is now over a year old and will soon (when 4.1 comes out) be two minor revs behind.
  - Update: rtree now requires BH 1.75.0 and R 4.0.0

- {vroom}
  - Version 1.4 of vroom, released on Feb 3, contains a bug that breaks phenoptr
    https://github.com/r-lib/vroom/issues/303
    Fix is not released, requires dev version of vroom

- General
  - The markdown format for including an image breaks in pandoc if there are spaces in the image path. This is an issue with reports using the html_vignette vignette format. A fix is to set
    knitr::knit_hooks$set(plot = knitr:::hook_plot_html)
  which uses an <img> tag directly and works fine in pandoc.
  - In general, path characters that are special to HTML cause trouble in pandoc, e.g. # and %. I haven't found a workaround for this.
  - How to communicate with users? How to identify & deprecate unused functions?
