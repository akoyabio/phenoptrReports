\usage{
process_singleplex_image(path, primary_fluor, percentile = NULL,
  n_bright = NULL, skip_fraction = 1e-04)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to a component_data.tif file}

\item{primary_fluor}{Component name of the signal fluor}

\item{percentile}{Percentile for high-expressing pixels. If omitted,
the brightest n_bright pixels will be used after discarding \code{skip_percent}.}

\item{n_bright}{The number of bright pixels to select for analysis.}

\item{skip_fraction}{The fraction of brightest pixels that will be ignored.}
}
\value{
A list containing
\itemize{
\item signals - The mean expression of each fluor in the selected bright pixels
\item sn - The expression of non-primary fluors as a fraction of the primary
\item primary - Component plane for the primary fluor (a large matrix)
}
