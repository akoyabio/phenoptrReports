## Overview

The "Spatial map viewer" addin allows viewing of nearest neighbor relationships
between cells of selected phenotypes in a single field. Views can be saved
for later use.

## Data requirements

### Consolidated data file

This addin reads data from the `Consolidated_data.txt` file created
by the "Consolidate and summarize" addin. 
It can also use the `nearest_neighbors.txt` or `count_within.txt` file
created by the "Analyze consolidated data" addin when 
"Save nearest neighbor / count within details" is selected.

### Composite and component image files

The viewer uses both composite and component image files for the fields of
interest. These files are written by the inForm export step.

The composite images are shown as the background of the nearest neighbor
visualizations. The colors and components shown are determined by the
inForm export settings.

The component images are the source of metadata about fields that is needed
to properly places cells in the visualizations.

## Detailed steps

### Start the spatial map viewer

Choose "Spatial map viewer" from the RStudio Addins menu to start the 
viewer.

### Select input files

The viewer's initial screen allows you to select the nearest neighbor 
file and inForm export directory containing the fields of interest.

1. First, click the "Browse input" button and select a
`Consolidated_data.txt` file from the "Consolidate and summarize" addin or a
`nearest_neighbors.txt` or `count_within.txt`
file created by the analysis addin.

2. Next, click the second "Browse" button and select the inForm output directory
corresponding with the data file.

3. Finally, click "Open Viewer" to start the viewer.

### Nearest neighbor viewer

The nearest neighbor viewer allows you to 

1. **Select and color phenotypes**
In this section, select the two phenotypes of interest and the colors
to use to display the phenotypes. Both single phenotypes such as `CD8+`
and multiple phenotypes such as `CD8+/PDL1+` are supported.

2. **Select a field to view**
Use the dropdown to select a particular field, or use the Previous
and Next buttons to browse through all the fields.

3. **Select the type of nearest neighbor relationship**
"Nearest neighbor" is not
a symmetric relationship---cell A may have a nearest neighbor B, whose nearest
neighbor is not A. Try the different settings to find the one you want.

4. **Control the dot size**
This slider controls the size of the dots displaying the cells. You may
want to make the dots smaller before saving images.

5. **Save a single view or views for all fields**
The "Save image" button will save the currently displayed image in your 
browser's Download folder. The "Save all" button will use the current settings
to save a zip file containing images of all fields in the experiment.
    - Select "Save data with image" to save a tab-separated data file 
    with the image(s).
    - Select "Show logo" to include the Akoya Biosciences logo in 
    the image(s). De-select to show or save images without the logo.

### Format of saved data files

If "Save data with image" is selected, a tab-separated data file is saved
with the image(s). The data file contains one row for each pair of connected cells, i.e. the
cells that are connected with a white line segment in the images.

- If "Save image" is clicked, the file will include data for
the single image. 
- If "Save all" is clicked, a single data file will be created
with data for all images.

In either case, the columns in the file will be

- Slide and field identifiers
- Location and phenotype columns for the "from" and "nearest" cells
- Distance to the "nearest" cell
